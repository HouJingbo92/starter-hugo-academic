Jingbo Hou is a Ph.D. Candidate of Information Systems at the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. He is on the job market this year (2022-2023).

Jingbo Hou is interested in advancing the understanding of the business implications of emerging digital technologies at both micro and macro levels. Regarding the micro-level impacts of digital technologies, he is interested in examining the role of online market designs (e.g., application costs, machine-generated content, non-personalized recommendations, and solution visibility) in alleviating the information asymmetries and improving the matching efficiencies for different types of online two-sided platforms (e.g., online labor market, online data sharing platform, and online crowdsourcing competition community). Regarding the macro-level impacts of digital technologies, he is interested in exploring the positive societal effects of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), e.g., telework adjustment and social media.
