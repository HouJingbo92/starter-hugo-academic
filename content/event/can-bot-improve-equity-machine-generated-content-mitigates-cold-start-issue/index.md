title: How Algorithmically Generated Content Reduces Evaluation Costs for
  Experience Goods
abstract: "Algorithmically generated content (AGC) is increasingly used by
  digital platforms to enhance user decision-making by reducing evaluation
  costs. This study examines the impact of AGC on the adoption of online
  experience goods, using Kaggle’s algorithm-generated exploratory data analysis
  (EDA) reports as a case study. We analyze how AGC facilitates dataset adoption
  by reducing the time and cognitive effort required to evaluate datasets,
  particularly in the early-stage cold start phase when user-generated content
  (UGC) is scarce. Our findings reveal that AGC significantly increases early
  adoption, with a more pronounced effect on datasets that lack alternative
  evaluation mechanisms, such as detailed product descriptions or provider
  reputation. However, AGC’s impact diminishes over time as UGC accumulates and
  evaluation costs decline. "
