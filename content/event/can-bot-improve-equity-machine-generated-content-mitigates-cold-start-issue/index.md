title: Can Bot Improve Equity? Machine-generated Content Mitigates Cold-Start Issue
abstract: The cold-start problem is salient in the current online two-sided
  markets. Theoretically, machine-generated content can serve as the information
  signal, thus helps to address the cold-start issue. To empirically examine
  whether machine-generated content helps mitigate the cold-start problem, we
  study the impact of machine-generated content on dataset adoption in a leading
  online public dataset community (Kaggle). We found that machine-generated
  content helps to solve the cold-start problem in the online public dataset
  community in two ways. First, we show that machine-generated content shortens
  the time needed for datasets to get their first adoption and that
  machine-generated content increases the dataset adoption in the initial stage
  and increases the dataset diffusion rate. Second, our results show that the
  positive effect of machine-generated content is stronger for dataset sharers
  who lack reputation signals. Our research opens a discussion on the role of
  machine-generated content in mitigating the cold-start problem in online
  public dataset platforms and also other two-sided markets.
