title: "Digital Paths to Prosocial Lending: The Impact of Social Connectedness
  and Digital Inclusion"
abstract: This study investigates the role of cross-country social connectedness
  via social media in influencing peer-to-peer (P2P) prosocial lending. While
  existing literature highlights social distances (e.g., cultural and religious
  differences) as one of the factors that reduce uncertainty for lenders, we
  complement this by examining the overlooked role of information exchange on
  social media. Building on the uncertainty reduction theory (URT), we argue
  that social connectedness through platforms such as Facebook enhances
  information flows, thereby increasing cross-country lending activities. Using
  panel data from Kiva and the Facebook Social Connectedness Index (SCI), our
  findings demonstrate that higher social connectedness is positively associated
  with increased lending volumes. These results are robust across different
  measures of SCI, various P2P platforms, and several econometric models.
  Furthermore, we show that digital inclusion—measured by i) access to Internet
  infrastructure, ii) autonomy in Internet use, and iii) the ability to use the
  Internet—moderates this relationship, reducing lenders’ reliance on social
  connectedness and encouraging more balanced lending behavior. These findings
  deepen our theoretical understanding of how online users utilize different
  information-seeking avenues to reduce uncertainty and provide implications for
  policy and practice.
