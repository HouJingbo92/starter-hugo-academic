title: COVID-19 Related Information via Social Network Shapes Preventative Behavior
abstract: People living in counties with higher social proximity to COVID-19
  severity information were more likely to take preventative measures (e.g.,
  social distancing and mask-wearing). Meanwhile, counties with higher social
  proximity to COVID-19 severity information experienced a slower spread of
  COVID-19. These relationships hold after we control for local cases,
  county-level time-invariant characteristics, state-level policies, and various
  types of physical ties to hard-hit areas. Overall, this research documents
  significant evidence showing the value of social networks in enhancing social
  awareness and shows how preventative measures induced by social awareness help
  mitigate the spread of the virus, while controlling away other alternative
  factors, such as local infections which increase local awareness, physical
  connectedness, which increases the likelihood of travel, and state policy
  responses to COVID.
