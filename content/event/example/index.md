abstract: The spread of misinformation online remains a significant concern,
  prompting various online platforms to adopt the crowdsourced fact-checking
  approach as a countermeasure. While prior research has focused on its
  short-term impact on user responses to flagged (or labeled) misinformation
  content, a more comprehensive assessment of its efficacy necessitates an
  examination of its long-term impact in a broader content scope. Using
  Twitter’s Community Notes program (formerly known as Birdwatch)—a crowdsourced
  fact-checking intervention—as the research context, we investigate the
  crowdsourced fact-checking’s long-term impact on shaping user response to
  labeled authors’ subsequent content. Specifically, we examine how crowdsourced
  fact-checking influences the audiences’ subsequent engagement with labeled
  authors and how it affects labeled authors’ subsequent content generation
  behavior over the long term. By employing the staggered timing of labels as
  our identification strategy, we find that community notes decrease audience
  engagement with labeled authors. Moreover, while it prompts labeled authors to
  reduce their post quantity, it does not significantly impact their post
  quality. This study contributes to the literature on crowdsourced
  fact-checking by extending the evaluation of its efficacy to a longer time
  horizon and broader content scope and bridging the responses of both
  misinformation consumers (audience) and producers (labeled authors).
