abstract: With the massive COVID-19 lockdown, teleworkability, i.e., the
  feasibility of telework, plays an important role in determining whether
  workers can maintain productivity and keep their jobs. However, the impact of
  teleworkability is likely to be heterogeneous, varying by worker
  characteristics, such as gender and childcare constraints. This study examines
  the heterogeneous impact of teleworkability on labor market outcomes
  (including unemployment, work absence, and layoff). Using stay-at-home order
  as a measure of labor market disruption, we find that teleworkability offsets
  the increase in unemployment due to the disruption of COVID-19 by 20%, that in
  work absence by 28%, and that in layoff by 26%. Specifically, the positive
  effect of teleworkability is i) stronger for females than males; ii) stronger
  for females with kids than their male counterparts as well as those without
  kids. Our study contributes to the emerging literature on gender inequality by
  underscoring the nuanced impact of teleworkability.
