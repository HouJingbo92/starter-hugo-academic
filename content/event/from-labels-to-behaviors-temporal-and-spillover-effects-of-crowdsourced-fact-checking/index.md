title: "From Labels to Behaviors:  Temporal and Spillover Effects of
  Crowdsourced Fact-Checking"
abstract: "Crowdsourced fact-checking, where users collaboratively label or flag
  potential misinformation content, has been increasingly used on online
  platforms to combat misinformation. However, its practical effectiveness
  remains unclear. This study evaluates its effectiveness across two key
  dimensions: content scope and time horizon, by examining spillover effects
  across content and temporal effects over both short- and long-term periods.
  Using the context of Twitter’s Community Notes program, this study
  investigates the impacts of crowdsourced fact-checking on: (1) audience
  engagement with labeled authors and (2) labeled authors’ content generation.
  Our findings reveal that community notes reduce audience engagement with
  labeled authors’ subsequent unlabeled content, likely because these notes act
  as a negative signal that undermines audience perception of the labeled
  authors’ credibility and social image. This audience disengagement effect is
  more pronounced for authors with lower popularity, suggesting crowdsourced
  fact-checking’s limited impact on disciplining popular authors. Additionally,
  labeled authors decrease the volume of their future posts, although their
  effort invested in each post remained largely unchanged. These findings
  highlight the effectiveness of crowdsourced fact-checking in two aspects: (1)
  reducing audience engagement with labeled information sources and (2)
  fostering a degree of self-discipline in labeled authors’ content generation,
  while also revealing a key boundary condition—author popularity—that shapes
  these effects. This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of the
  effectiveness of crowdsourced fact-checking and provides practical insights
  for platforms seeking to curb misinformation."
