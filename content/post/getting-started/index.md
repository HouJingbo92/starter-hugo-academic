  My research projects are at different review stages in top-tier journals. Particularly, I have papers under review in ***Management Science** (preparing for the 2nd round review)*, ***Information Systems Research** (under the 2nd round review)*, and ***Production and Operations Management** (preparing for the 2nd round review)*. I am also making good progress in preparing two papers targeted at *Information Systems Research*. In the next three years, I plan to keep working on these two streams with my dependable coauthors. In addition, with a strong interest in digital finance, I am ready to start two research projects related to cryptocurrency. A summary of my current ongoing projects is presented below.
