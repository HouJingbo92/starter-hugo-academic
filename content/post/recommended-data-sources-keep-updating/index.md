1. Given my interest in the societal impact of IS, several of my working papers leverage [Meta's Data for Good](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools). Meta offers various valuable metrics, including [social connectedness](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/social-connectedness-index) and [travel patterns](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/travel-patterns) between areas A and B. Additionally, the [social capital](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/social-capital-atlas) and [long tie ](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/long-ties)measure is particularly relevant from an IS perspective.
